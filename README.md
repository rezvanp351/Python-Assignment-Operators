# Python-Assignment-Operators
Assignment Operators in Python  Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They can be simple (like =) or combined with arithmetic/bitwise operators to perform an operation and assign the result in one step.
# ðŸ“˜ Assignment Operators in Python (Complete with Examples)

Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables.  
Some also perform operations (arithmetic/bitwise) and then assign the result.

# Bitwise Operators Truth Table

This table shows how bitwise operators work on two single-bit inputs `A` and `B`.

| A | B | AND `&` | OR `\|` | XOR `^` | NOT `~A` | Left Shift `<<` | Right Shift `>>` |
|---|---|---------|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0 | 0 |    0    |    0    |    0    |    1     |        0        |        0         |
| 0 | 1 |    0    |    1    |    1    |    1     |        0        |        0         |
| 1 | 0 |    0    |    1    |    1    |    0     |        0        |        0         |
| 1 | 1 |    1    |    1    |    0    |    0     |        0        |        1         |

### Explanation

- **A AND B (`&`)** â†’ Result is `1` only if both inputs are `1`.  
- **A OR B (`|`)** â†’ Result is `1` if at least one input is `1`.  
- **A XOR B (`^`)** â†’ Result is `1` if inputs are different.  
- **~A (NOT)** â†’ Inverts the bit: `0 â†’ 1`, `1 â†’ 0`.  
- **A << 1 (Left Shift)** â†’ Shifts bits to the left, fills with `0`, equivalent to multiplying by 2.  
- **A >> 1 (Right Shift)** â†’ Shifts bits to the right, fills with `0` (for positive numbers), equivalent to integer division by 2.  


## âœ… Summary
- Assignment operators are essential in Python.  
- They make code **shorter, cleaner, and more readable**.  
- The **walrus operator** (`:=`) is new in Python 3.8 and allows assignment inside expressions.
